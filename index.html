			<p class="header-subtitle">Discover the beauty of Cebu</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle">Cebu is a province in the Philippines that has a rich and complex history. Here's a brief overview:</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle"><b>Pre-colonial era:</b>
				Before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century, Cebu was already an important trading center in the Visayas region. The island was ruled by the Rajahnate of Cebu, a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that had trading relations with neighboring regions and countries like China, Java, and Sumatra.</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle"><b>Spanish colonial era:</b>In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer in the service of the Spanish crown, arrived in Cebu and claimed the island for Spain. He made alliances with some of the local rulers, including Rajah Humabon, and introduced Christianity to the island. However, Magellan was killed in a battle against the warrior chieftain Lapu-Lapu, who resisted Spanish rule. The Spanish returned to Cebu several years later under the leadership of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and successfully established their colonial presence in the island.
				Under Spanish rule, Cebu became the center of trade and commerce in the Visayas. It was also the site of important historical events, such as the Battle of Mactan and the formation of the Katipunan resistance movement.</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle"><b>American colonial era:</b>In 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States after the Spanish-American War. Cebu became a province of the newly established Philippine Commonwealth, and saw significant economic and social changes under American colonial rule.</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle"><b>World War II:</b>During World War II, Cebu was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army. The island was liberated by American and Filipino forces in 1945.</p>
			<p class="header-subtitle"><b>Post-war era:</b>After the war, Cebu became a center of economic development in the Philippines. It became a hub for trade, commerce, and tourism, and has played a significant role in the country's modernization and progress. Today, Cebu is a vibrant and bustling province with a rich cultural heritage and a thriving economy.</p>
